# Divide-Conquer_Technique
Title: Sorting elements in a list by breaking them into sub-lists. 
Problem Description: Run the program in java for varied values of n to demonstrate the behaviour of the algorithm in the Worst, Best and Average Cases. Record the time taken to sort. Plot a graph Of the time taken versus n on graph sheet. The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using the random number generator for large values of n. Method used: A Divide & Conquer- Recursive algorithm implementation- Merge Sort.
